        <h2> Why this Program?</h2>
        <p>
     The Doctorate of Science in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Program is an interdisciplinary program offered by the College of Computing, the College of Engineering, and the College of Sciences. The CSE program addresses the body of knowledge, skills, and practices associated with the study of computer-based models of natural phenomena and engineered systems. Students will be required to obtain a breadth of knowledge across a set of core areas in the CSE discipline, depth of knowledge in a specific computational specialization (e.g., numerical computing), and knowledge to apply computational techniques in a domain of application. Students will be expected to integrate principles from mathematics, computer science, and engineering to be able to create significant computational artifacts (e.g., software)
